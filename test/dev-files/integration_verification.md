## Deployment Instructions

1. Ensure all 5 core files are included in the deployment package
2. Upload to the WordPress plugins directory
3. Activate the plugin through the WordPress admin interface
4. Configure settings at Settings > Sumai
5. Add RSS feeds and set the daily summary schedule
6. Check that the Action Scheduler integration is working by:
   - Confirming scheduled actions appear in the Action Scheduler admin page
   - Verifying that API calls and post creation happen in the background
   - Monitoring the debug log for successful processing

## Performance Improvements

The Action Scheduler integration in v1.3.1 provides these benefits:

1. **Reduced Timeout Risk**: By offloading OpenAI API calls to background processes
2. **Improved Resource Management**: Main cron job completes faster, freeing server resources
3. **Better Error Handling**: Failed API calls don't crash the entire process
4. **Progress Tracking**: Status updates during background processing

## Post-Deployment Verification

Once deployed, verify the integration by:

1. Manually triggering a summary generation
2. Checking the Action Scheduler admin page for queued actions
3. Verifying that posts are created after background processing completes
4. Confirming that the daily cron job schedules background actions correctly

## Troubleshooting

If issues occur after deployment:

1. Check debug logs for error messages
2. Verify Action Scheduler is available (WooCommerce or standalone plugin)
3. Confirm WordPress cron is enabled or external cron is properly configured
4. Test manual summary generation to isolate scheduling issues
5. Verify OpenAI API key is valid and properly configured

---

This verification document confirms that Sumai v1.3.1 with Action Scheduler integration is ready for deployment. The integration successfully decouples API processing from the main cron job, improving performance and reliability.
