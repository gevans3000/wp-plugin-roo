## Human Testing Requirement
**IMPORTANT:** After each 3-commit cycle, a human must test the plugin via a zipped package in a WordPress environment. Development cannot continue until human provides test results and feedback. This ensures quality and proper functionality in real-world conditions.

## Version Management
**IMPORTANT:** The plugin version number in sumai2.php must be incremented before each commit (e.g., 1.0.3 → 1.0.4) to ensure proper version tracking during testing.

## Automatic Execution
**IMPORTANT:** All commands and file edits should be executed automatically without requiring manual confirmation when completing tasks. This ensures efficient workflow and minimizes interruptions during development.
